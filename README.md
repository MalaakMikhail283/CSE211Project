project description :
Use the Nucleo board and the Arduino multifunction shield available in the 
lab to implement the following project. 
Real time clock (RTC): 
It is required that after the board reset, the 7-segment starts displaying the 
elapsed time in minutes and seconds starting from zero. The least two digits 
count the seconds, and the high digits count the minutes. 
Pressing switch S1at any time restarts the clock from zero. 
Analog signal value display: 
What are the minimum and the maximum voltages from the on-board 
potentiometer? 
Use the potentiometer’s variable voltage as an input to the on-chip ADC. 
If switch S3 is pressed, the 7-segment should display the ADC’s input voltage 
value in volts. 
When S3 is released, the 7- segment switches back to displaying time. The 
RTC should not stop while S3 pressed.
